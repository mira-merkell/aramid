//! Synthetic fibers ðŸ§µ
//!
//! - _very much_ WIP ðŸš§.
//! - [Fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)) are
//!   little state machines that behave like coroutines: when spun, they yield
//!   and yield, and then they return. In the meantime, they carry their stack
//!   around with them.
//! - Fibers are a model of concurrent computation. They are static, lightweight
//!   and well-suited for cooperative multitasking.
//!
//! The enum [`State`](crate::State) contains utility methods for processing
//! yielded values, not unlike the Standard Library's `Result` or `Option`.
//! Closures that return a `State` can be turned into [fibers that live on the
//! heap](crate::HeapJob).
//!
//! ## Fibers and Iterators
//!
//! Additionally, fibers can be turned into iterators over their yielded
//! values...
//!
//! See [`iterators`][module-iterators] for more details.
//!
//! [module-iterators]: crate::iterators
